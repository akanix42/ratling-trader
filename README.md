# ratling-trader

I love rogue-like games. In my youth, I spent innumerable hours delving in the dungeons of [ADOM](http://www.ancientdomainsofmystery.com/) and [NetHack](http://www.nethack.org/), and for a long time have wanted to create my own rogue-like game. Naturally, the game I have in my head is very expansive, so I've put it off in favor of other projects. However, recently my desire has resurged, and I decided to start with a less ambitious rogue-like.

To that end, and with a bit of a hat-tip to ADOM, I have begun working on Ratling Trader. The player will take on the role of a ratling (a member of a humanoid rat race) trader who is just trying to hawk enough wares every day to provide for his family. *If you've played ADOM, I'm sure you'll remember the ratling traders from the arena. If not, well, go play it! It's a great, challenging adventure.*
Unfortunately, the local crime boss has taken a disliking to you and demanded that you pay a ridiculously large sum of protection money - or else. The game will focus on the player's attempt to deal with this issue within a certain number of turns, whether it be through selling enough of your wares to make the payment, or by other means...
